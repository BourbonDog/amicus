/**
 * Council Workspace — seats panel painter (v4.4 §5). D8 extraction (Task 1,
 * v4.6.2 PR4): moved verbatim out of workspace-panels.js, which was pressed
 * up against the 300-line size gate — this file is where Task 2 adds
 * dead-seat rows. Loads immediately before workspace-panels.js (index.html),
 * which keeps a thin delegate; reads `window.AmicusApp` at CALL time, same
 * discipline as every sibling renderer file (workspace-app.js boots last and
 * owns `state`).
